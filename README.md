# Similarity under Preference in Description Logic ELH

## Features
This project exposes JAVA-based APIs to measure a similarity of OWL-based class expression 
based on the logic-based semantics of the Description Logic ELH (see the requirements in [pom.xml](https://github.com/realearn-jaist/sim-preference-elh/blob/main/pom.xml)). 

The project is based on the [Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/cli.html). 
Its structure is organized as follows: 
* core: TBD
* batch-krss-dynamicprogramming-sim: TBD
* batch-krss-dynamicprogramming-simpi: TBD
* batch-krss-topdown-sim: TBD
* batch-krss-topdown-simpi: TBD
* batch-owl-dynamicprogramming-sim: TBD
